### 🔹 Amazon S3
- Stores uploaded notice attachments
- Files served securely via S3 URLs

### 🔹 Amazon DynamoDB
- NoSQL database for notices
- Schema-less, fast, highly available

### 🔹 IAM
- Manages role-based access control for EC2 + services

### 🔹 VPC (Optional)
- Secure networking configuration for EC2 environment
